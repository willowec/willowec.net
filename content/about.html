<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    I'm Willow, a senior Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Maine, Orono. I have a passion 
    for programming of all kinds, and am particularly interested in embedded systems and machine learning. Additionally, 
    I enjoy outdoor activities such as slacklining, climbing, and running.
